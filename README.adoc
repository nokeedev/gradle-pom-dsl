= Gradle's Ultimate DSL: The Maven pom.xml

Are you feeling nostalgic?
Do you remember a time when you wrote your build configuration in XML?
Search no more!

Turn your Gradle build configuration into simple pom.xml files.
This Gradle plugin will add support for the Maven Project Object Model (POM) DSL.
You are not dreaming; THIS IS FOR REAL.

== Getting Started

Simply download the link:pom.init.gradle[init script] into `~/.gradle/init.d` and start executing Gradle inside Maven projects.

CAUTION: We recommend you use `--init-script` or `-I` flag instead of the global init script folder.

== But, why?

Because.
Read the https://nokee.dev/blog/maven-pom-dsl/[announcement blog post], where you can see the plugin in action.
You can also try you link:src/docs/samples/README.adoc[the samples over here].
